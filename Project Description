# Taqueria-Panchito-Restaurant-Website

Date: September 2020 â€“ October 2020

The goal of this academic project was to create a website for a local Richmond restaurant,
Taqueria Panchito. Taqueria Panchito does not currently have a website and I wanted to create
one for them that included their menu, contact information, photo gallery, and about section.
Photos were incorporated from their Facebook for background images and photo gallery.
HTML5 and CSS/JavaScript were used for development and styling.
